Optimizing this would lead to different behavior depending on the time: In the beginning it is important for the robot to not fall down, but towards the end of the 60 s it may be a good idea to be more aggressive even if this would mean that the robot falls down after the 60 s are over (throwing itself over the finish line). \n","\n","To encode this into an MDP, we would have to include e.g. \"time left\" in the state. Then any state with \"time left = 0\" is a terminating state.

Since there is a risk that the Q-learning will find a policy that is not optimal in every possible state, you pass this part even if you only give the correct answer in 80% of the states asked for.\n","\n","Remember: When you have finished training your policy, you should use the greedy policy to answer the questions. If you use a $\\varepsilon$-greedy with $\\varepsilon$ > 0 there is a chance that you return an action that is not greedy w.r.t Q.\n","\n","Tips: When you are done training your agent, it is also fun to use test policy from Tinkering Notebook 3 to see your agent in action. This can also give you a feeling for if the agent seems to behave in an optimal way."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def train_q(agent, env, n_episodes, max_steps=50000):\n","    step = 0\n","    steps = np.zeros(n_episodes) # Steps after each episode\n","    total_rewards = np.zeros(n_episodes)\n","    actions = {}\n","    for i in range(n_episodes):\n","        state = env.reset()\n","        rewards=0\n","        done = False\n","        while not done:\n","            action = agent.act(state)\n","            actions[state] = action\n","            state_next, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n","            agent.learn(state, action, reward, state_next)\n","            state = state_next\n","            step += 1\n","            rewards += reward\n","            \n","            if step>max_steps:\n","                return rewards, steps, actions\n","                \n","        #actions[i] = action    \n","        steps[i] = step\n","        total_rewards[i] = rewards\n","    return total_rewards, steps, actions"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class QAgent():\n","    def __init__(self, n_states, n_actions, gamma, alpha, epsilon):\n","        self.n_states = n_states\n","        self.n_actions = n_actions\n","        self.alpha = alpha\n","        self.gamma = gamma\n","        self.epsilon = epsilon\n","        self.Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n","        \n","    def act(self, state):\n","        # Implement the self.epsilon-greedy policy\n","        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < (1.0 - self.epsilon):\n","            Q_list = self.Q[state, :]\n","            maxQ = np.max(Q_list)\n","            action_list = np.where(Q_list == maxQ)[0] \n","            action = np.random.choice(action_list)\n","        else:\n","            action = np.random.choice(self.n_actions)\n","        return action\n","            \n","    def learn(self, s, a, r, s_next):\n","        # Implement the Q-learning update\n","        s_next_list = self.Q[s_next, :]\n","        self.Q[s, a] += self.alpha * (r + self.gamma * np.max(s_next_list) - self.Q[s, a])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["+---------+\n","|\u001b[35mR\u001b[0m: |\u001b[43m \u001b[0m: :G|\n","| : | : : |\n","| : : : : |\n","| | : | : |\n","|\u001b[34;1mY\u001b[0m| : |B: |\n","+---------+\n","\n","State space:  Discrete(500)\n","Action space:  Discrete(6)\n"]}],"source":["env = gym.make(\"Taxi-v3\")\n","env.render()\n","print(\"State space: \", env.observation_space)\n","print(\"Action space: \", env.action_space)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["action_names = [\n","    'South (↓)',\n","    'North (↑)',\n","    'East (→)',\n","    'West (←)',\n","    'Pickup',\n","    'Drop off',\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["begin \n","\n","1 2 0 1 1\n"]}],"source":["agent = QAgent(env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n, gamma=1, alpha=0.1, epsilon=0.1)\n","n_episodes = 10000\n","print(\"begin \\n\")\n","total_rewards, steps, actions= train_q(agent, env, n_episodes)\n","print(actions[186], actions[227], actions[23], actions[376], actions[422])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["+---------+\n","|\u001b[34;1mR\u001b[0m: | : :\u001b[35mG\u001b[0m|\n","| : | : : |\n","| : : : : |\n","| | : | : |\n","|Y| : |B:\u001b[43m \u001b[0m|\n","+---------+\n","  (East)\n","Time step: 100\n","Reward: -1\n","Total reward: -163\n"]}],"source":["total_reward = test_policy(agent, env, max_steps=100)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
